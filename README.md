CueDB API
=========

What is CueDB?
--------------

CueDB is a database which stores Cue files that are generated with flac music files.
Sometimes, you'll come into the situation where you accidently lose your cuesheet,
yet you have your flac file. Instead of having to re-rip your flac file, you can
query this database to see if someone else has uploaded a cuesheet that matches the
album you have a rip of.

This repository holds the source of the API, which stores and retrieves the cuesheets
using gridFS.
